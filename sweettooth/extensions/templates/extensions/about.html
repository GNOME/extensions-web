<h2> What is GNOME Shell? </h2>
<p>
GNOME Shell provides core user interface functions for GNOME,
like switching to windows and launching applications. User
interface elements provided by GNOME Shell include the Panel
at the top of the screen, the Activities Overview, and Message Tray
at the bottom of the screen.
</p>
<h2> What are GNOME Shell Extensions? </h2>
<p>
GNOME Shell extensions are small pieces of code written by third party
developers that modify the way GNOME works. (If you are familiar
with Chrome Extensions or Firefox Addons, GNOME Shell extensions
are similar to them.) You can find and install GNOME Shell
extensions using this website.
</p>
<p>
Since extensions are created outside of the normal GNOME design and
development process, they are supported by their authors, rather
than by the GNOME community. Some features first implemented as
extensions might find their way into future versions of GNOME.
</p>
<h2> What can GNOME Shell Extensions do? </h2>
<p>
Extensions may make small changes, like moving your clock
to the right-hand side of the screen, or make big changes, like
arranging the windows in the Activities Overview in a different way.
</p>
<h2> Are GNOME Shell Extensions safe? </h2>
<p>
The code in a GNOME Shell extension becomes part of the core operating
system. For this reason, the potential exists for an extension to
cause system misbehavior, crashes, or even to have malicious
behavior like spying on the user or displaying unwanted
advertisements. All extensions uploaded to this site are carefully
reviewed for malicious behavior before they are made available for
download. This process of code review is similar to the process for
Firefox add-ons submitted to <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org">
addons.mozilla.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you encounter problems with an extension, such as a crash, make
sure to report the problem using the Bug Report link on the extension's
page.
</p>
<h2> I don't think I have GNOME Shell. What can I do to get it? </h2>
<p>
The easiest way to get GNOME Shell is to install a Linux distribution
that provides GNOME 3. See the
<a href="https://www.gnome.org/getting-gnome/">Getting GNOME</a> page on
the main GNOME site to learn how to grab a Linux distribution with
GNOME 3.
</p>
<h2 id="no-detection"> I'm using GNOME 3. Why can't I install extensions? </h2>
<p>
If you are using GNOME 3.4 or newer and installation still doesn't work,
check to make sure that the "GNOME Shell Integration" plugin is installed
and enabled in your browser preferences. Some browsers have a feature,
click-to-play, which make it so the plugin cannot start without user
intervention. Make sure that either <code>https://extensions.gnome.org</code>
is whitelisted for the click-to-play feature, or click-to-play is turned
off entirely. Check your browser's help for more details.
</p>
<p>
If you are behind a proxy, make sure you have configured your proxy in
both your browser's configuration dialog as well as GNOME's Network panel
under System Settings. GNOME Shell Extensions needs both settings panels
configured for the one-click installation to work.
</p>
<p>
Some distributions don't quite package GNOME correctly. Make sure that you
have the <code>unzip</code> package installed.
</p>
<p>
If you have checked all of these solutions and are still having trouble
installing extensions, please file a bug report using the link in the footer
of the page, giving your GNOME version, distribution and version, what
solutions you have already tried, as well as what the Looking Glass says
in both the Extensions and Errors tabs. It's also helpful to have a copy of
the <code>~/.xsession-errors</code> file from the session that you installed
extensions from.
</p>
<h2> How do I update my extensions? </h2>
<p>
To update your extension to the latest version, go to the extension's page,
or the "Installed Extensions" page, and click the green update arrow. If
there is no arrow, your extensions should be fully up to date.
</p>

<h2> What is «System extension»? How to uninstall it? </h2>
<p>
System extension is installed to system-wide location (usually «/usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions»).
Such extension may be used by any PC user, however it can be uninstalled only by system administrator (root).
To uninstall system extension use your distro's package manager or ask your system administrator.
